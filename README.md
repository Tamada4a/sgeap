## What is SGEAP?
SGEAP (Students guarantee excellent academic performance) - study project, prototype of application for SSAU students from SSAU students

## Prototype features
Prototype has only 4 pages:
- <strong>Map of SSAU campuses</strong>. I has reworked map we had to `svg` format with other icons on map. As i think, this version turned out to be more understandable and less overloaded:
